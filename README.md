# CISCO-PACKET-TRACER-PROJECTS
This repo is my personal collection of networking labs and setups I built while growing as a Network Engineer. It shows my skills in routing, switching, VoIP, wireless, and security using Cisco Packet Tracer. I use these projects to practice, test ideas, and share what Iâ€™ve learned with others who love networking.
